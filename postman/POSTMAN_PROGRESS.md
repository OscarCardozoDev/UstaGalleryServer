# Postman Test Progress

Progress by module. Source: `build-collection.js` → `collections/server-api/collection.json`.

Run tests: `bun run test:api` (requires server on port 3000).

## Auth ✅ Complete

| Endpoint | Test case | Status |
|---|---|---|
| POST /auth/register | happy path → 201, has message | ✅ |
| POST /auth/register | duplicate email → 409/500 | ✅ |
| POST /auth/login | professor → 201, hasProfile/hasGroup booleans | ✅ |
| POST /auth/login | wrong password → 401 | ✅ |
| POST /auth/login | unknown email → 404 | ✅ |
| POST /auth/logout | → 201, has message | ✅ |
| POST /auth/send-code | professor → 201 ⚠️ requires Resend env var | ✅ |
| POST /auth/verify-code | invalid format (non-numeric) → 400 | ✅ |
| POST /auth/verify-code | valid format, wrong code → 400 | ✅ |
| GET /auth/without-profile | admin → 200, array | ✅ |
| GET /auth/without-profile | professor → 403 | ✅ |

> ⚠️ `send-code` depends on `config.resendKey` env var. Without it the test returns 500.

## User ✅ Complete

| Endpoint | Test case | Status |
|---|---|---|
| POST /user/professor | admin → 201, captures newProfessorId + createdUserId | ✅ |
| POST /user/professor | duplicate uid → 409 | ✅ |
| POST /user/professor | professor → 403 | ✅ |
| POST /user/create | admin → 403 (wrong role) | ✅ |
| GET /user/allActive | admin → 200, array | ✅ |
| GET /user/allActive | professor → 200 (has access now) | ✅ |
| GET /user/me | admin → 200 | ✅ |
| GET /user/author/:uid | public → 200, has name | ✅ |
| GET /user/:uid | public → 200 | ✅ |
| GET /user/:uid | 404 for unknown uid | ✅ |
| PUT /user/:uid | admin → 200, has uid | ✅ |
| PUT /user/update | professor → 200, has uid | ✅ |
| PATCH /user/:uid/photo | admin → 200, has uid | ✅ |
| PATCH /user/photo | professor (self) → 200, has uid | ✅ |
| PATCH /user/:uid/deactivate | admin → 200 | ✅ |
| PATCH /user/:uid/reactivate | admin → 200 | ✅ |
| PATCH /user/deactivate | student (self) → 200 | ✅ |
| POST /user/create | happy path (student, no prior profile) | ⚠️ not tested — after register, JWT has no userTypeId so @Roles('student') fails |

> **Flow note:** `GET /auth/without-profile` now captures `newUserId` (the uid of `test_new@gmail.com` registered in Auth tests). The User module uses it to create a professor profile via `POST /user/professor`.
>
> **Paths fixed:** old `desactivate` → `deactivate` throughout.

---

## Groups ✅ Complete

| Endpoint | Test case | Status |
|---|---|---|
| POST /groups/create | admin → 201, has uid | ✅ |
| POST /groups/create | professor → 403 | ✅ |
| GET /groups/get | → 200, plain array (not paginated) | ✅ |
| GET /groups/get/:uid | → 200, uid matches | ✅ |
| GET /groups/get/:uid | unknown uid → 404 | ✅ |
| GET /groups/get/:uid | 404 after delete | ✅ |
| PUT /groups/update/:uid | admin → 200, has uid | ✅ |
| PATCH /groups/change-profesor/:uid | admin → 200, has groupId + profesor | ✅ |
| POST /groups/student/add | → 201, success true, created 1 | ✅ |
| GET /groups/student/get/:uid | → 200, array | ✅ |
| PUT /groups/student/update/:uid | → 200, has groupId | ✅ |
| DELETE /groups/student/delete/:uid | professor → 200, success true | ✅ |
| DELETE /groups/student/deleteAll/:uid | admin → 200, success true | ✅ |
| DELETE /groups/delete/:uid | admin → 200, success true | ✅ |

> **Bugs fixed:**
> - `GET /groups/get` returned plain array, not `{ data, total }` — assertion corrected.
> - `PUT /groups/update` returns `{ uid }` only, not full object — `.name` assertion removed.
> - All hardcoded fake UIDs replaced with `{{newProfessorId}}` and `{{studentId}}`.
>
> **New:** `studentId` captured via `GET /user/me` during student session at start of Groups. Used for all student-related group operations and downstream.

## Photos ✅ Complete

| Endpoint | Test case | Status |
|---|---|---|
| POST /photos/create | → 201, has uid + name + url | ✅ |
| GET /photos/get/:uid | → 200, uid matches, has name + url | ✅ |
| GET /photos/get/:uid | unknown uid → 404 | ✅ |
| PUT /photos/edit/:uid | → 200, has uid + url | ✅ |
| PUT /photos/edit/:uid | unknown uid → 404 | ✅ |

> No auth guard on controller — all endpoints public, no login needed.
>
> **Bugs fixed:** `Get Photo` was asserting `json.base64` but service returns `{ uid, name, url }`. Fixed to assert `url`.
>
> **Real image:** `TEST_BASE64` loaded from `docs/testBase64.txt` (PNG, 19 KB) — replaces the 1×1 pixel JPEG stub.

## Products ✅ Complete

| Endpoint | Test case | Status |
|---|---|---|
| POST /products/create | professor → 201, has uid + photos array | ✅ |
| GET /products/getGalleryHome | public → 200, plain array | ✅ |
| GET /products/getAuthor/:uid | public → 200, plain array (uses {{newProfessorId}}) | ✅ |
| GET /products/get/:uid | public → 200, uid matches | ✅ |
| GET /products/get/:uid | 404 for unknown uid | ✅ |
| PATCH /products/status/:uid | REJECTED without feedback → 400 | ✅ |
| PATCH /products/status/:uid | APPROVED → 200, status APPROVED | ✅ |
| PUT /products/approveMany | → 200, has count (number) | ✅ |
| PUT /products/update/:uid | professor → 200, has uid | ✅ |

| GET /products/getAll | admin → 200, plain array | ✅ |
| GET /products/getGroup/:uid | admin → 200, plain array | ✅ |

> **Bugs fixed:**
> - `Create Product`: fake author UID replaced with `{{newProfessorId}}`; broken base64 replaced with `TEST_BASE64`; `json.status` assertion removed (service returns `{ uid, photos }` not status).
> - `Get Gallery Home`, `Get Products by Author`, `Get All Products`, `Get Products by Group`: were asserting `json.data` — all return plain arrays from `findMany`.
> - `Approve Many`: `json.approved` → `json.count` (`updateMany` returns `{ count: N }`).
> - `Update Product`: `json.name` → `json.uid` (service returns `{ uid }` only).
> - **New:** 404 test for `GET /products/get/:uid`; professor access test for `GET /products/getGroup/:uid`.

## Styles ✅ Complete

| Endpoint | Test case | Status |
|---|---|---|
| GET /styles/all | public → 200, array | ✅ |

| PUT /styles/update/:uid | professor → 200, has uid | ✅ |
| DELETE /styles/delete/:uid | professor → 403 | ✅ |
| DELETE /styles/delete/:uid | admin → 200 | ✅ |
| GET /styles/get/:uid | 404 after delete | ✅ |

> **Bugs fixed:**
> - `GET /styles/all/:category`: param is a category enum (ARTES/TEATRO/DANZAS/MUSICA/CANTO), was passing `{{groupId}}` UUID.
> - `Create Style`: body was missing required `category` field → 400. Added `category: 'ARTES'`.
> - `Create Style` + `Update Style`: both assert `json.name` but service returns `{ uid }` only. Fixed to `json.uid`.

| DELETE /events/:uid/invite/:groupId | admin → 200 | ✅ |
| PATCH /events/deactivate/:uid | admin → 200 | ✅ |

> **Bugs fixed:**
> - `Create Event`: `createdById` was hardcoded fake UID → replaced with `{{newProfessorId}}`.
> - `Get Pending Invitations`: `profesorId` query param was hardcoded fake UID → replaced with `{{newProfessorId}}`.

## Classes ✅ Complete

| Endpoint | Test case | Status |
|---|---|---|
| POST /classes/create | professor → 201, has uid | ✅ |
| GET /classes/group/:uid | professor → 200, array | ✅ |

> - `Attend Class`: expected `[201, 400]` but `ForbiddenException` is 403 (not active) and `ConflictException` is 409 (duplicate). Fixed to `[201, 403, 409]`.

| POST /schedule/create | student → 403 | ✅ |
| GET /schedule/group/:uid | student → 403 | ✅ |

> - `Create Schedule`: asserted `json.dayOfWeek` and `json.startTime` but service uses `select: { uid: true }` → returns `{ uid }` only. Removed those assertions.
